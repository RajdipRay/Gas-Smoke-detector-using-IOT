Smoke detectors do not last forever. It&#39;s a good idea to replace your smoke
detectors every 10 years to make sure you have reliable detection of fires. Most
models have a test function that lets you periodically check them to catch
potential problems early. Test your smoke detectors monthly and immediately
replace any units that do not respond as they should.
Get new detectors after a decade even if the old models still seem to be
functioning. Older units may sound when you press the test button, but that
doesn&#39;t tell you how well the sensor works. The test response simply tells you that
the electronic components and alert part of the detector still work. You can test
the sensor by using smoke alarm test spray, but it&#39;s still a good idea to change out
any units older than 10 years. The sensor could stop working at any time. Not sure
how old your unit is? Look on the back side for a date. That&#39;s the manufacture
date, and it&#39;s what you should use to calculate the 10-year mark, even if you
installed it much later.
