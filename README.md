# Gas-Smoke-detector-using-IOT
Smoke Detectors play a very important role in Industries, Shops, Malls, Residential complexes, parking areas etc. They help in detecting smoke or gas at an early stage and can help in saving lives. Commercial Fire detecting systems usually have an alarm signalling, with the help of a buzzer or Siren. We have designed an IOT based Fire Alerting System using gas and smoke sensor which would not only signal the presence of smoke in a particular premise but will also send related information through IOT. In this Arduino fire alarm system using gas and smoke sensor using IOT project, we can send LIVE information like Temperature, Smoke Value detected by a particular device to the Fire Department. The use of early warning fire and smoke detection systems results in significant reduction in fire deaths. The sooner a fire is detected, the better the outcome for saving lives. This document provides guidance for the proper operation of fire detection systems for those who apply, install, and maintain them. Correct installation and maintenance of smoke detectors prevents unwanted nuisance alarms. Occupants can become desensitized when repeated nuisance alarms occur. In worst case scenarios, technicians could disconnect alarms from the system to avoid the unnecessary disruption. Either situation negates a detectorâ€™s potential life saving benefit, making the proper operation of an early warning fire and smoke detection system indispensable.
