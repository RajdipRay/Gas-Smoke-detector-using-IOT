Once a smoke detector senses smoke, its next job is to let people know about it.
That warning can make the difference in whether or not people in the home have
time to escape. Effective detectors should have alarms of at least 85 decibels at
10 feet, so they can be heard throughout the home. Smoke detectors are often
located outside of bedroom doors. That means the alert sound needs to be loud
enough to go through doors and wake up sleeping people in case of a fire at night.
Detectors should also have a low-battery notification function that makes a
repetitive beep when the battery power is nearly drained.
